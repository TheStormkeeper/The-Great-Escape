<div class="boxTitle">Code which empties beds writes to ROM</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The routine at <a class="link" href="../asm/41447.html">A1E7</a>, which empties beds, has seven iterations but iterates over a list which is only six items long. The final write performs a write to ROM location $1A42.

<div><a name="discoverOffByOne"></a></div>
<div class="box box2">
<div class="boxTitle">Off-by-one in is_item_discoverable</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The routine at <a class="link" href="../asm/51346.html">C892</a>, which searches for items dropped nearby, decrements HL when it finds a nearby item. However, it doesn't restore it when it resumes iterating, meaning that subsequent iterations will search the wrong structure member.

<div><a name="spotattr"></a></div>
<div class="box box1">
<div class="boxTitle">Spotlight attribute</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Sometimes the nighttime spotlight will set the attributes of the barbed wire game screen border.

<div><a name="pauseclear"></a></div>
<div class="box box2">
<div class="boxTitle">Pause doesn't always clear the screen</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Pause doesn't always clear the full game screen. You get a two-row high sliver of pixels left behind.

<div><a name="solitarymental"></a></div>
<div class="box box1">
<div class="boxTitle">Player goes nuts in solitary</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Sometimes the player will go nuts when put in solitary. He'll run up against the topmost corner of the room and keep running.

<div class="boxTitle">Bribe prisoner and he turns into a boiler</div>
<div class="paragraph">
"If you try and bribe a prisoner with the chocolate when you are in the lower of the 3 prisoner huts, he will walk towards you and as he does he will flash alternately as himself and a boiler." (zx1)
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Similarly (or possibly the exact same case): you can bribe boilers and crates. They change into characters and start walking around.

"When the hero then moves through the fence automatically after cutting the wire, he can go garbled momentarily." (Bandit)
"The dog sprite when walking down and right has one frame of incorrect height, 15 pixels instead of 14. This means that if you look closely below the dogs' rear legs, you should see 2 pixels from the next frame." (Bandit)
"I got the lockpick and went to the solitary cell and picked the lock, i left an object in the cell (the radio) just to see what would happen. I was caught later somewhere i shouldn't and was sent to solitary. When the Commandant came to collect me he just stopped when he entered the room and everything stopped, obviously the programmers never thought anyone would so this!" (zx1)
"the position of the moveable objects (stoves/crate) don't reset when starting a new game" (jp)
"a0b8: jp $a0bb		;unnecessary instruction ($a0bb follows)" (bandit)
"c902: jp nz, $c917	;jump if red (unnecessary jump, ret nz enough)" (bandit)
